# Statistically dependent dice

This repository is designed to house information related to my attempt at writing code to create a method of rolling dice that will dynamically change its outcome probability to match the theoretical distribution. This is an active repository. I will post information about the files below, so please reference this markdown first if an issue or concern arises.

I welcome feedback, questions, or comments you may have about any file in this repository or about the repository as a whole. Please feel free to reach out at eegalles@gmail.com. 

### main.py

  - Description: current version of the script to roll dice
  - Current task: cleaning up variable names and comments
  - To-do: clean up the plots, possibly outsourcing functions from main.py to additional_functions.py. The big picture is to put this on a simple website. This would be a good intro project for understanding very basic web design
  - Issues: the variable names and comments could be a little better, I'll clean it up to improve readability soon
  - General notes: this file name may change because it might just be a function that's called for a cleaner, more user-friendly script

### additional_functions.py
  - Description: file to house functions for main.py
  - Current task: none
  - To-do: none
  - Issues: none (that I'm aware of)
  - General notes: this might get busier soon as I look to move functions from main.py over to this file
