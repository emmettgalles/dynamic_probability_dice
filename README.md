# Dynamic probability dice

This repository is designed to house information related to my attempt at writing code to create a method of rolling dice that will dynamically change its outcome probability to match the theoretical distribution. This is an active repository. I will post information about the files below, so please reference this markdown first if an issue or concern arises.

I welcome feedback, questions, or comments you may have about any file in this repository or about the repository as a whole. Please feel free to reach out at eegalles@gmail.com. 

### main.py

  - Description: current version of the script to roll dice
  - Current task: finding a way to make it so each roll is initiated by the user
  - To-do: not sure on the small steps yet, but the big picture is to put this on a simple website. This would be a good intro project for understanding very basic web design
  - Issues: right now I have a very crude plotting setup to visualize what's going on after each iteration, it makes the script run very slow because it has to remake a plot each time
  - General notes: this file name may change because it might just be a function that's called for a cleaner, more user-friendly script
